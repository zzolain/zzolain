### Hi there 👋

I'm Jinsol Kim, a front-end developer with 4+ years of experience.

I'm interested in ergonomics & UI/UX and love❤️ the works that make people's life more convenient.

What I learned is recorded on my blog https://jinsol.kim and it would be a pleasure if you visit there.

Eventhough I majored in not CS, but Psychology & Design, I believe those things will be connected all together.
