### Hi there 👋

I'm Jinsol Kim, a front-end developer with 4+ years of experience.

I'm interested in ergonomics & UI/UX and love❤️ the works that make people's life more convenient.

What I learned is recorded on my blog https://jinsol.kim and it would be a pleasure if you visit there.

Eventhough I majored in Psychology & Design, I believe those things will be connected with development all together.

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
